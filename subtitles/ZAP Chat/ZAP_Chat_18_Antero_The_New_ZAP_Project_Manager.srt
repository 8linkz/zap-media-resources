00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello, and welcome to another episode of ZAP Chat. And the observant among you might have realised

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,040
that Yannis isn't here, instead of being joined by Antero. So, there's a couple of reasons

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,080
for this. One, Yannis has got a new job at the Hellenic National Cyber Security Authority,

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,720
which we're delighted for him, which means he's very busy. I'm sure we'll be back before

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,620
too long. But I also wanted this opportunity to introduce Antero to everyone. So, Antero,

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,620
take it away.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,080
Hi, hi, guys. Thanks. Thanks for getting me here and letting me be part of this project. So,

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,600
my name is Antero Silva. I'm a product manager at Checkmarx. And we recently have now the

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,880
core team of ZAP onboarded into our world and into our company. And yeah, and I'm glad

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,720
to be part of this journey and helping on the ZAP

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,040
Open source project in, you know, focusing on the future and, you know, helping out Simon

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,720
and the core team on addressing what we should be focusing on first. That's the main current

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,220
goal for me within the ZAP project.

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:19,040
Brilliant. I mean, basically, the way we worked out what to work on before was very much kind

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,440
of finger in the air, what do we think is most important? And until last year, the only

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,620
person I had to worry about was myself, because I'm the only person 

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,080
I could tell to do anything, because everybody else is a volunteer. Last year,

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,380
Ricardo was able to join full time, as many of you will know. So, it ended up myself and

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Ricardo going, what do you think we should focus on? So, that's been the process. Now,

20
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,400
we've also got Rick joining as well. And working out what you should do is actually really

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,600
hard. Project management is just one of those things that take a lot of time and a lot of

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,140
experience. And we've now got Antero to do this, which is great. That saves a lot of

23
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,620
hassle.

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:06,060
But obviously, this is, and Antero has got kind of two views on this, as the same as I have as

25
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,020
well. Because one is we're looking at Checkmarx customers, but two, a very important aspect is

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,240
everybody else using ZAP. And, you know, you're not forgotten. And that's a very important part

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,660
of this. ZAP is a community project, and we want people to get involved, and we want to do things

28
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,440
that actually you want us to do. So, Antero, can you explain kind of the

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,360
new process or the way we'll work?

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,900
Exactly. So, I'll start managing the ZAP projects as I'm managing another open source project,

31
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,660
which is KICS for ISE security, which the premises is basically the same. We do have an open source

32
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,760
project, and then we have the enterprise solution within Checkmarx. So, our intention with ZAP,

33
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,920
it's the same. ZAP is an open source project. It's going to be a community project, and we have no

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,940
intention of changing that.

35
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,340
In the near or long-term future, there's no intention of changing that. So, the roadmap is basically

36
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,400
constructed upon feedback. That's our main source of knowledge, right? So, I've been in a lot of

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,980
customer meetings, a lot of demos, and having your feedback is, you know, it's truly important as a PM

38
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:26,140
to have access to. So, you can always go into the issues within GitHub for the repository for

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,680
ZAP and create a new entry where you can just say, you know, this is the one thing I will have in

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,240
mind that will help me a lot in my process. Detail as much as you can in that feature request or in

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,300
that new requirement, and we'll, you know, evaluate the possibility of incorporating within ZAP.

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,340
Now, look for already existing issues if you want to just, you know, vote for what's already out

43
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,280
there. And based upon that, you know, the number of likes we do have,

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,360
in a single feature, we can address if it's more urgent or less urgent to be able to implement it.

45
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,000
So, feedback is key. If you're not, if you don't give us your voice, we won't hear it, basically.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,840
Yeah, exactly. So, hang on, let me just share my screen, and I will now try and

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,520
guide you through this.

48
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, so, so,

49
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,600
basically, this is the ZAP website. So, rebranded as ZAP by Checkmarx. Now, if you go to the

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,720
community section, this is where we've got a lot of information here, and one of the key places is

51
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,560
the user group. So, it's a really great place to start, and one reason we often say to do this is

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,960
we often get issues raised, or we see people say, you know, I wish ZAP did this. It's like,

53
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,120
it already does. We keep on getting requests for things we already handle, and this could be a

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,880
a problem with our documentation you know I completely understand that but ZAP is a big

55
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,540
complex project so it does a lot of things already so if you're unsure about how to do something

56
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,160
the ZAP user group is the place to start but if we say on there great suggestion please raise an

57
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:20,540
issue or if you want to go straight there then we go down here we will see the the the full set of

58
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:27,380
repos we've got 47 there but you have a look at the main ones that a proxy and in there we've got

59
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:36,100
issues now I've actually got quite a few 788 which is yeah it's it's that's been going for quite a

60
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,460
while but what we do is we keep an eye on the things that are the people care about most and

61
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,520
one way you can do that is you actually look at the thumbs up in the first comment and that gives

62
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
us the the

63
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,480
the things that people as far as we can see most care about so you can see the top one is actually

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,600
persistent fuzzer settings and the next one is macOS distributions not from verified developer

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:09,440
and the first one is from 2015 so but the thing is this is the these are the ones you voted for

66
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,900
the most and what you'll see is we've actually got this new backlog tag and these are as it says

67
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,480
there issues the core team think a higher priority and would like to work on again any given

68
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,280
time so this is what these are the things that we think are important. So when I'm talking to

69
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,720
Antero about okay yeah these are the things we think we should be doing. So if we haven't got you

70
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,300
know obviously we'll have other inputs, but stuff coming from the core team is important, you

71
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,600
know. We know what's going on and we know what things we think we need to do and we know we

72
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,960
have to do. So these are the kind of things we've tagged right now and you'll see the persistent

73
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,460
fuzzer settings and the macOS distribution the two things that we've tagged right now are the

74
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,800
two you've voted for most are in that list. So at this stage there's no promises when we're going

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,980
to get any of these things done, because there's a lot of things going on, but we now have more people

76
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,820
than ever to actually work on things. So um so fingers crossed things will actually be able to

77
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:17,300
do things um much more effectively and much quicker. Yeah, so what I can promise on my end is

78
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,240
that I'm going to review all of these requests

79
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,380
try to assess what's more urgent in my perspective also align with you know the feedback we have been

80
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,380
getting from our Checkmarx customers or even not even customers but potential customers so

81
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,900
what's being requested within the market itself, you know what our competitors have and we don't

82
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,780
things like that and I'll aggregate all of that data and address okay let's focus on what we can

83
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,300
do uh next year. So we are currently constructing the roadmap for 2025

84
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,980
and I'll consider everything so the issues, your direct feedback, our customers feedback all will be

85
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:05,000
grouped together in one single source of truth and then address, you know with our capabilities

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,620
and with our you know resources what we can do and what we'll focus on first. Right so get in touch,

87
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:18,320
get in touch for the user group vote on issues raise new issues we do want to hear from you you.

88
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
You know ZAP is there for people to use

89
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,480
we want it to be as effective as possible so please get in touch. I'll also start a thread

90
