00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,620
Hello and welcome to another episode of ZAP Chat with myself and Yannis.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello, long time no speak. How have you been, Simon?

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,320
I've been great, thank you. And you?

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,620
Good, I can't wait to get into this 2.16 release features with you.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,780
Exactly, and that's what we're talking about today.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,260
ZAP 2.16, which we released just under two weeks ago, I think it was.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,840
So let's get straight into it.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:41,240
And what I'll do is I will attempt to share my screen.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,580
Where's it coming up?

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,740
And make sure I share the right one.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,560
And hopefully you can now

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,920
see ZAP.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,780
So what's new here? Where shall we start?

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,140
Well, I mean, it kind of looks 2.16 will look very similar to 2.15.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,480
Apart from we've got the new checkmarks branding, which you may or may not be able to see depending on where the window appears with our faces in.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,380
But we've also, if you see there's a news item and if you click on that, then you will be taken to the ZAP blog post where we've got everything explained

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,800
or kind of high level things.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,080
And I'm not going to read this out, but I am going to use it as a prompt to remind me everything's in there.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,140
And the first thing is you're no longer Java 11 isn't good enough.

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,760
You've got to have at least Java 17.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:51,940
So we always kind of we try and keep up with not the latest and greatest version of Java, but we don't want to get too old because there's performance improvements and there's new fun things that we can play around with.

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,480
So you need a minimum of Java 17, I'm afraid.

23
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:06,340
So what's the so if I've got some scripts using Nashorn, what's the process of migrating them to Graal?

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,520
Yeah. So thank you for reminding me that even though it's in front of me in the screen.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Basically, Java 11, they included the Oracle included the Nashorn JavaScript engine, and that's no longer included in Java 17.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,420
So that's why we've moved to Graal.

27
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,280
Now, in most cases, you won't have to do anything.

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,620
Many scripts will just work.

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,960
We put some code in there which detects you're using Nashorn and changes it says, no, we're releasing Graal and everything will be fine.

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,240
However, there are some features which will not just work straight across.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,120
So have a look at the migration guide, which is linked in the release notes and on the blog.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,460
So follow the migration guide, everyone

33
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,220
and it should be a piece of cake, he says.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,680


35
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,940
Famous last words. If you've got any problems, just come back to us through the normal channels.

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
Exactly.

37
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,660
Yes.

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,600
So the next feature is a big one.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,240
Now, this is one where we were going to release ZAP 2.16 just before Christmas, but we decided to hold on because of the client spider.

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,900
So we already have two spiders.

41
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,240
We've got the traditional spider and we've got the Ajax spider.

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,780
So we've decided to add a third one.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
Well, if you've got one, it should be the only one.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,340
But if you've got two, there's definitely room for a third one, right?

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
So what's new in the client spider?

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,900
Well, the traditional spider is very much works with traditional web apps.

47
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,800
It makes requests, analyzes responses, HTTP, HTML responses, and does a standard crawling thing.

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:52,460
That doesn't work with modern web apps because modern web apps typically use a lot of JavaScript and the links and the controls are all in JavaScript, which the traditional spider can't understand.

49
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,340
You really need to have.

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,780
A real browser parsing and rendering the pages in order to explore a modern web app.

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,480
That's what the Ajax spider does.

52
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,100
The trouble is we know it isn't as effective as it could be.

53
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:22,240
We actually based the Ajax spider on a third party open source project called Crawl Jax, and that is quite big and quite complicated and it is maintained kind of on and off.

54
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,240
So it has been fairly effective.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:52,460
But we thought it could be better, so we have submitted some patches to it in the past, some of those have emerged, but it still doesn't work in quite the way we'd like, so we've written a new spider and that's the client spider and there's quite a lot to talk about, so I think we should do a separate session on this, but what I will do is I will show you very quickly if you go into ZAP and then go into the tools menu, you'll find the client spider there and you can run it just in.

56
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,280
It's very similar to run as the Ajax

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:08,800
Spider and it works in fairly similar way, but it is subtly different and so far it's proved more effective, it's a bit faster and more effective in many cases, but would love you to try it out.

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,260
So the next very next video we should cover the client spider and go into that in a lot more detail.

59
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,300
What I like about this client spider is that it gives me the novice developer the ability to access the full DOM.

60
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Through the ZAP browser extension, so beforehand I didn't have that through the Ajax spider, so more to come on that a separate video.

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
What else is new in 2.16 Simon right?

62
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, something for those of you use the ZAP GUI.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
We have detachable tabs, so that is something I can show you very quickly.

64
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,640
Basically you can right click on any tab and you can move it to a new window and this will work with as many tabs as you want.

65
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760


66
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,360
So if you want the scripts tab, maybe we can have that in a new window.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,600
Now, this is not so great on a small screen.

68
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
If you've got one screen and it's fairly small, you might not find this very useful.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,880
However, if you've got multiple screens, you'll find this incredibly useful because you can have,

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,600
you can put the tabs wherever you want.

71
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
You can move them around, resize them.

72
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,720
They'll they'll slot that they follow the standard Windows guidelines.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
So they slot.

74
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
Become full screen or half screen, all those kind of things.

75
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
And if you close them, then they just go back to wherever they were.

76
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,480
So yeah, that's something if you got, if you use a ZAP desktop

77
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
and you've got multiple screens, then you can have a lot of fun with that.

78
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,680
Who said that it's only developers that get to be into a flow state, right?

79
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,400
And you need to out tab or control tab between flow states as a security professional as well,

80
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
when it comes to pen testing or whatever you might be doing.

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,400
I used this in the fuzzing session.

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
It just makes things so much simpler, right?

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Especially adding, deleting payloads and so on.

84
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,320
Plus you could time it with the other keyboard shortcuts and just,

85
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,040
okay, you might have to, you know, press tab a few times,

86
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,320
but get to the relevant menu without even touching the mouse.

87
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,160
Really helps being in that flow state.

88
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,120
Definitely.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,720
And this is something where I think we haven't spent enough effort in making the ZAP GUI better.

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,640
So it's something I know we're actually at one of the core team members is very keen on.

91
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:22,960


92
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,040


93
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,200


94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,360


95
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,440


96
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,760
Looking at the needed, the detached tabs.

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,680
Um, so, uh, yeah, more, more will be coming, no doubt.

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,960
So next up is standard policy definitions.

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,600
So the policy definitions, these are the scan policies

100
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,640
that you can select when you're performing an active scan.

101
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
And we've supported these for many years,

102
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,880
but we haven't actually specified any specific definitions.

103
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,520
So we've left it up to you to make your own decisions.

104
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,720
And you can still do that.

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,960


106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
So you can still define your own scan policies.

107
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
We're not taking that...

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,920
We're definitely not taking that ability away from you,

109
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,240
but we've had a lot of cases where people have asked us,

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
what do we think we should be?

111
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,280
People should be running.

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,440
And so we've been thinking about it

113
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
and we've come up with a set of scan policies

114
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,240
and I won't go through all of them now.

115
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
And we should probably have a separate session on this.

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,720
So we'll do another video on these in the future.

117
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
What we've got is a set of policies

118
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,240
that we think work well in particular situations.

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,720
And if you go into any one of them,

120
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,040
you'll see details about them

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,000
and you can actually go in

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
and see the individual rules that are enabled.

123
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,800
Yeah, absolutely.

124
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Have a play everyone.

125
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
My favorite is the API policy,

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,600
because we don't have a lot.

127
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,560
I mean, we have the top 10

128
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,480
and we have a lot of standards of how to look at APIs,

129
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,120
but we've never grouped at a, you know, collection of rules,

130
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,240
active rules, right?

131
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,200
What an API policy should look like.

132
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
So answers on a postcard

133
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,760
in the next video

134
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
on more detail in each

135
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,100
of those policies.

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,300


137
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,5


138
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,100
Absolutely.

139
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
So that was standard policy definitions.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,140
And then another one.

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,100
Now this one sounds a little bit trivial.

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,140
So we've got the ability to export the site tree.

143
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,180
And we actually have a format,

144
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,140
a defined format for the sites tree.

145
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,180
So it's YAML.

146
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,600
And hey, so what? You can export it what's what good is that?

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,280
That is one where we're going to have to have another video for it,

148
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,960
because we've also got the ability to prune the sites tree.

149
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
And this suddenly gets very interesting,

150
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,880
particularly in CICD,

151
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,840
because if you want to do a very quick scan

152
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,240
of just the things that have changed,

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,920
then this site tree export and pruning does actually allow it.

154
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
So it means you can do very fast,

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
very effective scanning,

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
DAS scanning in CICD.

157
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,520
So we'll have another video about that

158
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,920
but,

159
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,200
that is enabled in this release.

160
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,560
I think one day soon,

161
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,280
there's going to be an RFC with your name.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
I want my name in another RFC.

163
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,640
You could have all the glory

164
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,000
and the team can have all the glory

165
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,040
involving a common standard

166
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
of what a site tree format should look like.

167
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,400
So this is definitely a step in that direction.

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,440
And we need more standardization between tools.

169
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,280
We'll probably invite some of the other teams as well to contribute.

170
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,720
Absolutely.

171
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah.

172
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,280
No.

173
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
We definitely want to.

174
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
There's a lot more standardization

175
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,600
that would really help the industry.

176
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,520
So there's an open source project.

177
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,600
We are always delighted to be involved in those efforts.

178
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,360
So what is sequence scanning to somebody who's just used 2.16

179
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
and that's their first experience of ZAP?

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Right.

181
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
Well, we've had a sequence scanner for quite a while.

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
I think it was a Google Summer of Code project.

183
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
And this is where you have a site where they're,

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:49,460


185
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,520


186
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,600


187
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:49,680


188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:49,760


189
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:49,840


190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:49,920


191
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,160


192
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,240


193
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,400


194
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,480


195
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,560


196
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,640


197
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:50,720


198
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,800


199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:50,880


200
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:50,960


201
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,040


202
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,120


203
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,200


204
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,240


205
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,280


206
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,400


207
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:51,440


208
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,720


209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:51,740


210
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:51,800


211
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,920
sequences. 

212
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,840
So it could be a wizard or it could be a set of steps that you typically go through in order.

213
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,400
And if you try and go to the last step,

214
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,600
it won't work if you just go straight to it.

215
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,760
So you need to go through a certain step, you know,

216
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,480
imagine your wizard.

217
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
You've got step one step two step three,

218
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,360
and you can put,

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,240
you know,

220
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,960
there's input on each three of these steps and say there's

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,400
a vulnerability on the third step,

222
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,360
but you can't find it by going straight to step three,

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,400
because,

224
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,720
Yeah.

225
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:19,960
Yeah.

226
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,820
The application would be an invalid if that wasn't

227
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,240


228
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,960
state and you'll get rejected. Now we've had a sequence scanner before but we had a reason to

229
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,540
actually look into it in a bit more detail and we found it wasn't quite as effective as we liked

230
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,180
and it was it ran particularly slowly and the cases we didn't handle very well at all

231
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:45,840
so we put quite a bit of work into this so the sequence scanner is now beta status and it is

232
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,200
included in ZAP 216 by default and we will definitely have to have another

233
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
one of these ZAP chats about it because there's a lot more to talk about

234
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,360
hold your breath everyone for the more experienced users when it comes to sequence scanning think of

235
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,920
selenium right that's where i think the rationale steps from and you know you've got to kind of you

236
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,800
know click here go to add something to the cart in a shopping context and then go to checkout and

237
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
then you know

238
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:15,820
you know

239
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,180
cross out script the specific payload of the number of you know items that you've put in the

240
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,460
shopping cart right otherwise it doesn't work because it needs an object for the dom xss to

241
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:33,040
to work so that's the kind of rationale behind sequence scanning um why move the passive scanner

242
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,380
into an add-on i quite enjoyed the passive scanner just being there doing its thing as i was browsing

243
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,680
the internets of the world it will still be there uh this is part of a long-running

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,020
process we've got we've been trying to get stuff out of the core uh so even though you know

245
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,840
passive scanner used to be part of the core the fact that it's not part of the core won't make

246
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,260
any difference to you really it'll still be there it includes no releases the traditional spider is

247
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,640
used to be part of the core is no longer part of the core um we've been trying to move stuff out

248
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,480
of the core and the reason is we can only update things in the core every time we do a full release

249
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,520
like 216 and 275

250
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,620
but you know we don't expect another release out for at least four months uh and we like to be able

251
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,040
to push changes and fixes out very quickly if things are in add-ons we can update them within

252
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,440
hours you know we can get a change out we can get it released very very quickly it takes quite a lot

253
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,860
a lot of effort to make a core release so we're trying to move all the significant functionality

254
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,500
like the passive scanner out of the core and that's one of the ones we did done this release

255
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,400
very good so still there still

256
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,460
run runs as it should yeah should be no change at all apart from the fact if there's any bugs we

257
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,380
should be able to fix them quicker

258
00:13:53,380 --> 00:14:03,660
then uh i mean the last major one is last but not least automation framework enhancements and this

259
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,320
is like a handful so yeah and i think this is gonna have to be another session uh we've decided

260
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,620
we're gonna try and keep these um ZAP chat videos a little bit shorter uh so we'll split this one

261
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,660
out again but

262
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,060
basically there's a new set of jobs um so with active scanning exporting pruning client spider

263
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,700
so a lot of these jobs are really related to the other um changes that i mentioned earlier

264
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:34,060
uh there's an exit status one uh but we'll explain all of that uh in a another session

265
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,700
but if you use the automation framework then do have a look at these enhancements because

266
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,460
there could be something which will be exactly what you're looking for

267
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,860
what i like about the 216 release is that it shows the maturity now of that attack proxy if you think

268
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,620
about grouping items together be it policy rules that come together jobs when it comes to automation

269
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,060
or moving things out of the core that shows that we're trying to you know move forward strategically

270
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,180
as we said before in a agile manner whereby you've got components that can have different levels of

271
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,000
maturity different versioning when it comes to add-ons and at the same time we're offering

272
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,400
uh a framework with the reliability of the card consciousness and i like that very much

273
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,420
for the development of the expo companies because it's basic science we're going to

274
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,620
deal particularly with well-structured homepage people who want to go in an openenned Tolladeren

275
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,620
but they really want to make sure that it comes with basic features and maybe the old

276
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,640
constructs so things like that um and and opening up that uh the platform

277
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,580
and the mentioning of virtual privacy is obviously very important all of as well as creating a

278
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,520
slutty

279
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,200
uh because we're moving some more stuff into add-ons in fact we've got more now and there's a

280
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,040
various reasons for that i mean we have been holding a few things back because we wanted to

281
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,640
be part of the new release uh but one of the main reasons is um is thanks to check marks employing

282
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,360
three of the core team we're doing a lot more work now and so we've got three people working

283
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,080
full-time on ZAP uh we've been able to do a lot more and there's a lot more coming we've got a

284
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,400
load of fun things coming along and we're going to be very busy recording these videos because

285
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,720
there's a lot to talk about all right off we go to the next video that's 216 everyone

286
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,720
and uh yeah see you next time
