Hello and welcome to a brand new series of videos about the Zed Attack Proxy, otherwise known as ZAP.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For those of you who don't know, ZAP is a tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's open source and completely free.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In this series, we plan on having pretty short videos, 10 to 15 minutes, covering specific ZAP features.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And these could be new features, older features we haven't covered in videos before, or maybe we have covered them, but they've changed quite a bit.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And there are quite a few of those.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So it's probably not ideal for people completely new to ZAP.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So if you are new to ZAP, then have a look at zaproxy.org, because we've got lots of other videos that might be better for you.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But if these videos appeal, then please subscribe.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And if there is anything specific you'd like us to cover, then please mention it in the comments below.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hope you enjoy them.
