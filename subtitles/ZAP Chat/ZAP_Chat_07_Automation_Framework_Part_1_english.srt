00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
Hello, and welcome again to another episode of ZAP Chat.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,960
And once again, we have Yiannis with us. Hi, Yiannis.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,100
Hello. Yes, yes, yes. That time of week, everyone.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,660
So what are we doing this week, Simon?

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,580
Good question. So this week, we are going to cover the automation framework.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Although we're not going to cover all of the automation frameworks, there's quite a lot.

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,000
And we want to keep these talks between 10 and 20 minutes each.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,260
I think we've ran over last week. Never mind.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,020
So we'll probably have several episodes on the automation framework.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,760
And that means you can just watch the ones that you want to watch about the relevant sections, relevant bits.

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,200
So without further ado, we will get into this and I will share my screen.

12
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,520
Let's dive straight in.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Make sure I share the right one.

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,240
And hopefully you can see the ZAP website.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,200
We can indeed. We can indeed.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,640
Great. And I'll move some of the toolbars out of my way so I can see what's going on.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,180
So what I wanted to show you is start with if we go to documentation.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:26,380
Now, I did mention that last week when we're talking about the different options for automation,

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,060
that we had some getting started..

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,780
getting started guide.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
And we were going to add some getting further guides.

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,180
And we have the start of the getting further guide with automation.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,700
And as you'll see, it's not finished yet.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,160
But what I wanted to show was the automation options, because these are the things we covered last week.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:53,180
And what we've got is a table at the top, which shows all the options, ZAPit, Quick Start, Package Scans, GitHub Actions, Automation Framework, and API.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,060
And it compares ease of use with the flexibility and functionality.

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,840
So as you can see,

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,820
the easiest ones to use are things like ZAPit and Quick Start, but they don't have very much flexibility.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:17,700
So what we have is, and I talked about the other options last week, but the automation framework is really what we're aiming for.

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,160
It's a good balance of ease of use and flexibility and functionality.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,520
So something like the API is really powerful, but it's harder to use.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,980
And the idea is the automation framework should be a really good option.

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,780
For most people automating ZAP.

34
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:44,700
So I think it's important, Simon, to just quickly cover that, you know, basically the automation framework is made up of a set of jobs, right?

35
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,240
Exactly.

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,880
You'll have different needs based on your different jobs.

37
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,660
And as you said, like, we'll be here for two and a half hours, we've covered all of them.

38
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,960
So what are you thinking that we're covering today in terms of the jobs of explaining further the automation?

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,500
So I was just going to really start with the GUI, which is a bit strange because it's automation.

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,480
So why have we got a GUI?

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,500
Well, it kind of makes things easy to set up.

42
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,980
But actually, when you said that, I just realized something that came up in a user group on the ZAP user group post recently.

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,620
Someone saying, well, if I start ZAP in different ways, does it do different things?

44
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,960
And the answer is no.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,620
If you start ZAP by the automation framework, it'll do the same thing if you do the same things via the API or the desktop.

46
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,580
So.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,440
All of these interfaces are just ways of controlling ZAP.

48
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:40,380
And most of them you can, depending on how flexible they are, but you can do exactly the same with the package scans that you can do with the automation framework.

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,020
Or the automation framework can do everything the package scans can do, but the package scans can't do everything the automation framework does.

50
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,200
So let me switch over to ZAP.

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,460
So I'm running the latest weekly again.

52
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,300
And what you need to do is.

53
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,420
The automation framework is configured via the automation tab here at the bottom.

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,180
And actually.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,540
And we covered this a little bit last week, right?

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,740
We said that it's very important.

57
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:17,200
You're probably going to fail miserably doing this on a plan on a TXT file if you can't get it right in the GUI, right?

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,560
So it's best to start with the graphical user interface.

59
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,420
And what better place than to put the plan here in?

60
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,360
Exactly.

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,260
And one thing I will..

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,220
..I will switch back to

63
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:35,580
the docs and go to documentation and then we got automate and automation framework.

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,460
So this is all the documentation of the automation framework.

65
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,660
It has over the framework, all and all of the jobs here.

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,300
So you won't necessarily have all of these jobs available because it depends on what add-ons you've got installed.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,440
And if you go into each of these, you can actually see, let's have a look at the active scan.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,160
You'll actually see.

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,660
We give the YAML free for that particular job.

70
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,780
So every job here has its own YAML.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:12,340
So as you said, Yiannis, you can go in and create the YAML file in a text editor and hopefully it will work, but you know, it's, it's a bit of messing around.

72
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,840
So if you're used to these things, great.

73
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,900
But if you're new, then start with the desktop.

74
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,800
So we have various options here.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,160
We've got some toolbar buttons and we've got an option for the only ones that are enabled at the moment

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,280
are a new plan and loading a plan.

77
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,460
So this is new plan and we have, one of the key things is you have to choose a context.

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:49,120
So automation framework plans have to have a context and those contexts have to have URLs, which I think we covered last time because we didn't actually, we created one.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,260
It didn't have a URL and it failed.

80
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,320
So we also have all of the jobs.

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,940
So these are all of the jobs that I have available based on the add-ons that I've got installed.

82
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,580
And we have profiles.

83
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,620
Now you don't have to use these profiles, but these are just quick ways of selecting relevant jobs.

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:15,480
So we have the baseline, we have importing, where we, with import job, we've got GraphQL, OpenAPI.

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,320
So this just selects different jobs based on profiles.

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,140
You know, if you've got an OpenAPI definition, you probably don't need the spiders.

87
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,900
Absolutely.

88
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:35,640
And I think it's important to say here, Simon, that basically the profile is a collection, a pre-configured collection of jobs.

89
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:51,480
For example, when somebody says, Hey, I've just done a ZAP baseline scan, effectively with or without the automation framework, they are in some contexts, having selected a predefined set of jobs, which correspond to that profile, which is the baseline.

90
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,160
Exactly, exactly.

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,220
And you don't, you know, if you, if you actually select, you know, 

92
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:03,480
you say, okay, I'm going to do a custom scan and you can select whichever of these jobs you like, and you can change them afterwards as well, which I'll show.

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,680
But I'm going to start with a baseline scan because it's nice and quick.

94
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,240
And what you'll see is I will just make this tab a little bit bigger.

95
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,200
You'll see them.

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,540
We have these jobs down here.

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,080
And at some point I'll try and make these columns better size automatically.

98
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,220
Slightly better size.

99
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,400
Yeah.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,200
So just for argument's sake, Simon, let's just say that.

101
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:34,100
The website that we're using, well, actually the website that we are going to be targeting, does not have any Ajax, right?

102
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,800
There's no asynchronous JavaScript there.

103
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,300
Exactly.

104
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,380
How would I remove the Ajax spider job?

105
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:50,600
Well, so what we've got, we've got these jobs and if you select any one of them, you will see that some of these other buttons are enabled.

106
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,480
So what we can actually do is we can add jobs.

107
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,260
We can move jobs.

108
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,120


109
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,620
We can move jobs up and down.

110
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:07,000
So let's say, to start with, say you actually wanted one of the Ajax spider before the standard spider, you could just move it up and then we'll see it changes.

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:19,940
Now, as you said, I mean, one reason for, you know, we're going to use example.com and we know that doesn't need the Ajax spider, so we can just go in and we can remove the job and there it's gone.

112
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,280
And if you want to add it back in or add any of the other jobs back in, then you've got the full list.

113
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:36,780
So you can basically add, even though you've, you know, this initial new plan dialogue gives you a list of jobs, but you can change them.

114
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,260
And one thing you'll see is, you know, you can only actually have what, if you start the plan that way, you can only have one of each jobs, but say you want two reports.

115
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,500
Well, we could actually then go in and say, we will add a, another report job.

116
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,260
And then it brings up the

117
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,940
full template.

118
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,100
So we then got two jobs, report jobs, but I will remove one of those because we don't need them.

119
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:14,880
And what that also shows is if you actually double click on any of these things, if I can get the, my mouse to work, then you'll see a lot more information.

120
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,420
So each of these jobs has the problem, the GUI there.

121
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,740
So you can actually see each of these jobs has a whole set of options.

122
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,520
And what we try and do is make sure out of the box, they work well.

123
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,060
But let's work, let's go through these very quickly.

124
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,620
We have the environment and the environment is actually absolutely key.

125
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,920
So you can't have an automation framework plan without an environment and we've got some parameters.

126
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,760
We can fail on error, fail on warning and put the progress to standard out.

127
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,920
So what you can say is each of these jobs can give warnings or errors, and you can choose.

128
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,860
What the exit code is based on those things.

129
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,660
Very important.

130
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,320
If you're doing any type of continuous integration or continuous development, right?

131
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,140
Exactly.

132
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:19,040
And we have variables here, which I think I'll cover, more in more detail in a future episode, but basically you can put any variables in and you can actually use things like system environmental variables as well, which is great for credentials.

133
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,300
So we can add more context if we like.

134
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,260
And if we double click on this context, we can actually see we've got the standard include, exclude and technology.

135
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,120
So we can say what technologies are relevant for this particular context.

136
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:54,280
And I'm going to start with, Oh, if it's spelled correctly... now, if I had, so I didn't have a URL previously in

137
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:09,460
my default context, but if I'd chosen the context with configuration, then we'd have picked up all of that configuration and it's worth saying that it'll pick up things like authentication, even though it doesn't currently appear in this automation GUI.

138
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,400
We need to fix that.

139
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,720
So we now have the environment set up now, the passive scan config.

140
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,780
Now this job, all it does is configure the passive scanner.

141
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,760
And so this is something that you.

142
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,260
typically

143
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,100
want to run very early on.

144
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,900
Now you might actually want to have more than one instance of these things because you can actually configure rules.

145
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,300
So you can say, okay, I want to turn specific rules on or off.

146
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,340
And if you have a look here we have an option to disable all rules if we want.

147
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,040
And this is something you can't actually do from the standard GUI.

148
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,240
We can say, I want to disable all rules and then enable specific ones.

149
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,360
And this will then apply to all of the passive scanning from this point.

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,180
And this is why you might want to have another of these.

151
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,500
So you might want to spider with specific set of rules and then spider again with a different set of rules.

152
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,620
If that makes sense.

153
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,360
Yeah, that's, that's really important in the context of narrowing down specific checks.

154
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,620
Right.

155
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,560
And now we're doing the passive scan, but imagine it in the context of an active scan where you're only checking for, let's say, I don't know, SQL injection.

156
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,000
Right.

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,120
And you just want to make sure.

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,260
Yep.

159
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,820
Same with passive scan config.

160
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,780
You could do that.

161
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,280
And then you could have different rules different type of config.

162
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,200
Exactly.

163
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:43,940
And so, as you would have seen there with the rules, by did there, you know, basically we've got the option here to, turn them all on and off.

164
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:53,360
But then we can actually have every, all of the passive scan rules that I have available to me are available here.

165
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,100
And we can choose

166
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,980
the threshold, which is off, low, medium, or high to go very fine rate.

167
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,620
Yeah, very fine control of this.

168
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:10,480
And this is true across all of ZAP you've got, you know, there's huge amount of configuration, which can be a bit confusing to start with.

169
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,880
Then what we're going to do is run the spider.

170
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,400
So we really need to, you need to explore your application for that.

171
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
We're going to use the spider.

172
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,580
Now we can choose the context but

173
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:23,900


174
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,580
basically we'll choose the first one.

175
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,900
If we don't specify anything we don't have a user set up, so we can't do authentication.

176
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,280
You can choose to start a different URL.

177
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,220
So we've got example.com as our context.

178
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:46,180
We could choose to start a lower URL example.com\app1 one or something, but we're not going to do that here.

179
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,080
Max duration, depth and children...

180
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,900
..These are all standard ZAP spider configurations, but we've got advanced options.

181
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:03,080
So we've got a whole load of things that you don't usually need to configure, particularly when you're getting started, but they're there.

182
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:10,340
So if you need to, then you can still configure all these things from the from this dialogue.

183
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,900
Then one thing we've got is this passive scan wait.

184
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:23,840
So what happens is the passive scanner has a set of threads and it will passively scan all of the requests and responses.

185
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:23,880


186
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,780
So it goes through ZAP, but you don't want to run the report straight away or do things immediately.

187
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,720
You want to wait until these, these threads are finished.

188
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:42,040
So, we never know when something really has finished because you could then start making more requests, but basically we have a passive scan queue.

189
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,460
When that drops to zero, that's when this job will finish.

190
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,460
So again, you could have multiple of these.

191
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,760
You could actually wait for the passive scanner to finish off the spider and then carry on to do the

192
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,040
Ajax spider.

193
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:06,180
And one reason you might want to do that is the standard spider can detect whether there are, whether it looks like it's a modern web application.

194
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,560
And then the Ajax spider has an option to actually, only run if it looks like it's a modern web app.

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,240
Yeah.

196
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:21,780
So you want to cover all of spidering modern and classic before you, you know, say that you've tested a website for, again, SQL injection for argument's sake.

197
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,120
Right.

198
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,920
Because otherwise.

199
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:23,760
Yeah.

200
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,900
If you haven't done your spidering, you're going to be lacking a few parameters and locations.

201
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,500
Exactly.

202
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,580
You know, if you, you have to explore your application effectively in order to actually, allow ZAP to do its job.

203
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,260
And finally, we've got this report.

204
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:53,640
So we have a whole, you know, I think I choose, I'll choose traditional, PDF report and you see, we have sections, we have filters that we can, choose which risks and

205
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:53,740
confidences

206
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:07,100
can put in, we can choose which sites we want description, all these things, we can set the name so we can do all of these wonderful things and we can actually choose to display the report automatically.

207
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,040
So that is the, that's walking through this very quickly.

208
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:22,840
And one thing you may or may not have noticed is we have automatically, when you add the spider, either of the spiders, then you get a job test.

209
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:35,520
And tests are actually key, because one thing with automation is you can set it up, you can check it's working, and then you want it to just run day in, day out.

210
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,860
Now, what happens if something changes and it doesn't do what you expect?

211
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,060
This is something that is, a significant problem with these, this type of testing.

212
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,060
So what we have is you can add job tests and we automatically add

213
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,860
ones into the spider.

214
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,320
And what you'll see is right now, we're not failing.

215
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,340
We're looking for at least 100, automation.spider.urls.added.

216
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,460
So this is checking that ZAP has actually found as many URLs as we expect.

217
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,320
Now we won't find a hundred URLs on example.com, but that's the default we put in.

218
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,940
So if we go back to the documentation and go up to documentation.

219
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:29,680
And scroll down, you'll see internal statistics, and these are all of the statistics that ZAP maintains.

220
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,360
So you can see there's quite a few, and these are filterable.

221
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,320
So we put in spider, you'll see automation.spider.urls.added.

222
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,900
So this is the, statistic that we're going to test.

223
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,320
And as you see, there's lots more statistics.

224
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,460


225
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:59,200
So there's lots of ways you can check that these scans are doing exactly what you expect and continue doing whatever you expect.

226
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:08,080
And you can change these rules and you can kind of, you can add more so we could actually add more tests here.

227
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,900
And again, this is something that I'll probably, well, I think we will definitely cover in a future episode.

228
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,220
But what I'll do now is I've kind of showed adding, removing jobs, moving jobs up and down.

229
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,780


230
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,440
and briefly touched on removing and adding tests.

231
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,420
So now I'll run it.

232
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,620
And what you'll see is you can see the progress.

233
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:30,940
There you go.

234
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,800
The report gets, because I chose the report to be displayed, it gets popped up on my screen and we can see that.

235
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,160
Yep.

236
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:46,160
You can actually see the progress and you can see how long these things took and you can see one of these things failed.

237
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,800
And.

238
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,920
This makes sense.

239
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,920
That's failed because example.com for, for those viewers that don't know

240
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,440


241
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,620
it is a domain that has been reserved for use and documentation, right?

242
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,560
There's a single static page with one link to IANA.org.

243
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,460
So of course there are no hundred URLs to be crawled or spiders.

244
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,160
Exactly.

245
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,680
And that's why I did it.

246
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,620
I did a passive scan here because I do not have permission to do an active scan on example.com.

247
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,560
And remember, you should only do use ZAP to attack applications

248
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,840
you have permission to test.

249
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,620
Yes.

250
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,400
Permission

251
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:21,760
very important,

252
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,140
very important permission.

253
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,340
Yes, absolutely.

254
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,140
So here you'll see, we have an output tab and we can see the progress.

255
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:37,640
So you can see that the passive scan job was started, how long it took it found four URLs and it failed because the

256
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,620
job test failed because we were expecting a hundred URLs and four is less than a hundred.

257
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:50,740
But we didn't fail at the overall, job because that was just an info level rather than warn or fail.

258
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,080
So what we can do now.

259
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:02,580
So this is what we've seen is you can create automation framework plans in the ZAP desktop and you can run them and you can check what's going on.

260
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,980
This is great because then you can then see exactly what's happening and prove to yourself that it's doing what you expect and what you want it to do.

261
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,160
And what we can do now is we can save the plan and yep.

262
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,940
Good.

263
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,660
So I will call it ZAP Chat.

264
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:31,140
And what we'll do now is I will quit out and no more graphical user interface for today.

265
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:43,200
Exactly, and so I should be in the right place and we have a look at, I think it was in the zap chat directory.

266
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,140
You'll see zapchat.yaml.

267
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,140
So I'm now going to run ZAP again and...

268
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,000
So I'm running the, I said weekly, the latest weekly.

269
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,100
..So, what I - so this is the command I used to start the ZAP desktop.

270
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:14,880
So start on port 9090, because I've got Tomcat on 8080, and I specified a directory so that it didn't carry on using my, the standard directory that I use for testing because that would just mess things up.

271
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,420
But what I want to do now is I want to run from the command line and not have the GUI.

272
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,640
So minus command.

273
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,420
And then minus auto run.

274
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,540
And actually, I could really do with the current working directory.

275
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:41,420
So that's always better to actually specify the full directory directory.

276
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:50,140
So minus command minus auto run that directory slash zap.

277
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:57,860
it was zapchat.. zapchat.yaml.

278
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,280


279
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,700
So there we have it, we've got the port just so it's not starting on the standard on the 8080.

280
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,200
I've got a directory there, minus command and minus auto run.

281
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,780
So start up and there we have it.

282
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,340
We see that...

283
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,740
Yeah, exactly.

284
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,120
So it did exactly the same

285
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,080
thing so the report gets shown on my desktop because I chose that option it's not the default

286
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:33,020
but just good for demos and we can see that what happens was we've seen exactly the same thing

287
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:40,020
we found and we found it's failed again but that hasn't but we're still saying the automation

288
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:48,200
automation plan has succeeded. Now what I'll just do is I will go in and I'm going to show you this

289
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
plan and change it actually just quickly.

290
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:04,640
Oh yeah so here we have it and you'll see that we've got the the environment first with

291
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,420
the context and it's put a load of default stuff in here and we've got fail on error

292
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,540
and fail on warning. So I'm going to actually change to fail on warning.

293
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,160
Oh.. And we'll go down and again we've just got all the default stuff has been put in

294
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,280
but here I'm going to change it on fail.

295
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,900
So we're actually failing if we don't find as many files as we expect.

296
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,180
So basically we're going to get to the job that involves testing for the 100 urls I think it was

297
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:47,360
job number three or four from memory.. yep.. and then it's going to stop. That's the hope.

298
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,400
That's the hope indeed. Oh and cannot invite on fail value so I put the wrong thing in. So it's

299
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:06,320
lucky we have documentation around this so let me just go in and check so automate automation

300
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,620
framework I thought fail was a good op but it was a good chance there but..

301
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,120
Info warning.. oh there we are.. So

302
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:31,040
error..error..there you go and it's not warning it's one so it's four letters.. yep yeah so yeah so so it's

303
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:39,560
shown I haven't done as good preparation I should have done so on fail so that was on fail..

304
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
..but this is yeah error..

305
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,800
The other thing that we can do but let's not do stay for this is a good exercise for the people

306
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,860
at home is you can change this to be a warning and then set the fail to warning so that the plan

307
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,680
fails upon a warning as well which.. Exactly.

308
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,920
So there.. We are right.. So they see so it's failed and one thing it does show that if we

309
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,020
pick up that there was a bug in the

310
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,980
the if there's a mistake in the yaml it also won't run. So.. so.. so if that being good about done

311
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,100
it deliberately but just for you with us it doesn't mean we you know you can still put in

312
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,820
some yaml that gets past the ZAP parser and it still can cause problems but where we can we

313
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,080
will try and identify things that are wrong and fail before we actually run any of the jobs.

314
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,140
But here you can see that we failed the Spider because it didn't find enough

315
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:54,080
URLs and it didn't go ahead and create the report. So it just stopped

316
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:04,380
where we were. So that is an introduction to the Automation Framework. Wonderful

317
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,820
stuff Simon. So just to remind people basically the Automation Framework we

318
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:18,080
think is a really good mix of ease of use and functionality and so it's a kind

319
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,980
of recommended way to automate ZAP unless you're doing some trivial automation

320
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:27,620
and it's easy to set up via the desktop. You can see exactly what's going on and

321
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,060
test it there then you can export it as a YAML file and run it from the command

322
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,040
line. And that's it and so next week I think we're gonna I think we should

323
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,980
carry on with the Automation Framework. There's quite a lot to cover. There's loads more, exactly what we'll cover.

324
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,600
We'll have a chat and work out. So until then thank you very much and

325
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,620
please add comments to the YouTube video. Let us know what you think and

326
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,640
what else you'd like us to cover. Thank you very much and until next time.
